    <p><em>by Ian Goodfellow and Nicolas Papernot</em></p>

<p>In our <a href="http://www.cleverhans.io/security/privacy/ml/2016/12/15/breaking-things-is-easy.html">first
post</a>,
we presented a few ways that an attacker can break current machine learning
systems, such as by poisoning the data used by the learning algorithm [BNL12],
or crafting adversarial examples to directly force models to make erroneous
predictions [SZS13]. In this post, we’ll take adversarial examples as an
illustration of why attacking machine learning seems easier than defending it. In
other words, we cover in detail some of the reasons why we do not yet have
completely effective defenses against adversarial examples,
and we speculate about whether we can ever expect such a defense.</p>

<p>An adversarial example is an input to a machine learning model that is
intentionally designed by an attacker to fool the model into producing an
incorrect output. For example, we might start with an image of a panda and add
a small perturbation that has been calculated to make the image be recognized
as a gibbon with high confidence [GSS14]:</p>

<div style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:30px;"><img src="Is%20attacking%20machine%20learning%20easier%20than%20defending%20it%3F_files/adversarial-example.png" width="75%"></div>

<p>So far, it is much easier to design tricks like this that fool a model than it
is to design models that can’t be fooled.</p>

<h3 id="how-have-we-tried-to-make-ml-models-more-robust-to-adversarial-examples">How have we tried to make ML models more robust to adversarial examples?</h3>

<p>Let’s
take a look at two defense techniques, adversarial training and defensive
distillation, as examples of how a defender can attempt to make a machine
learning model more robust and mitigate adversarial examples.</p>

<p><strong>Adversarial training</strong> seeks to improve the generalization of a model when
presented with adversarial examples at test time by proactively generating
adversarial examples as part of the training procedure. This idea was first
introduced by Szegedy et al. [SZS13] but was not yet practical because of the
high computation cost of generating adversarial examples. Goodfellow et al.
showed how to generate adversarial examples inexpensively with the fast
gradient sign method and made it computationally efficient to generate large
batches of adversarial examples during the training process [GSS14]. The model
is then trained to assign the same label to the adversarial example as to the
original example—for example, we might take a picture of a cat, and
adversarially perturb it to fool the model into thinking it is a vulture, then
tell the model it should learn that this picture is still a cat. An open-source
implementation of adversarial training is available in the
<a href="https://github.com/openai/cleverhans">cleverhans</a> library and its use
illustrated in the following
<a href="https://github.com/openai/cleverhans/blob/master/tutorials/mnist_tutorial_tf.md">tutorial</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Defensive distillation</strong> smooths the model’s decision surface in adversarial
directions exploited by the adversary. Distillation is a training procedure
where one model is trained to predict the probabilities output by another model
that was trained earlier. Distillation was first introduced by Hinton et al. in
[HVD15], where the goal was for a small model to mimic a large, computationally
expensive model. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04508">Defensive distillation</a>
has a different goal of simply making
the final model’s responses more smooth, so it works even if both models are
the same size. It may seem counterintuitive to train one model to predict the
output of another model that has the same architecture. The reason it works is
that the first model is trained with “hard” labels (100% probability that an
image is a dog rather than a cat) and then provides “soft” labels (95%
probability that an image is a dog rather than a cat) used to train the second
model. The second <em>distilled</em> model is more robust to attacks such as the fast
gradient sign method [PM16] or the Jacobian-based saliency map approach
[PMW16]. Implementations of these two attacks are also available on
<a href="https://github.com/openai/cleverhans">cleverhans</a>, respectively
<a href="https://github.com/openai/cleverhans/blob/master/tutorials/mnist_tutorial_tf.md">here</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/openai/cleverhans/blob/master/tutorials/mnist_tutorial_jsma.md">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-failed-defense-gradient-masking">A failed defense: “gradient masking”</h3>

<p>Most adversarial example construction
techniques use the gradient of the model to make an attack. In other words,
they look at a picture of an airplane, they test which direction in picture
space makes the probability of the “cat” class increase, and then they give a
little push (in other words, they perturb the input) in that direction. The
new, modified image is mis-recognized as a cat.</p>

<p>But what if there were no gradient—what if an infinitesimal modification to
the image caused no change in the output of the model? This seems to provide
some defense because the attacker does not know which way to “push” the image.</p>

<p>We can easily imagine some very trivial ways to get rid of the gradient. For
example, most image classification models can be run in two modes: one mode
where they output just the identity of the most likely class, and one mode
where they output probabilities. If the model’s output is “99.9% airplane, 0.1%
cat”, then a little tiny change to the input gives a little tiny change to the
output, and the gradient tells us which changes will increase the probability
of the “cat” class. If we run the model in a mode where the output is just
“airplane”, then a little tiny change to the input will not change the output
at all, and the gradient does not tell us anything. Let’s run a thought
experiment to see how well we could defend our model against adversarial
examples by running it in “most likely class” mode instead of “probability
mode.” The attacker no longer knows where to go to find inputs that will be
classified as cats, so we might have some defense. Unfortunately, every image
that was classified as a cat before is still classified as a cat now. If the
attacker can guess which points are adversarial examples, those points will
still be misclassified. We haven’t made the model more robust; we have just
given the attacker fewer clues to figure out where the holes in the models
defense are. Even more unfortunately, it turns out that the attacker has a very
good strategy for guessing where the holes in the defense are. The attacker can
train their own model, a smooth model that has a gradient, make adversarial
examples for their model, and then deploy those adversarial examples against
our non-smooth model. Very often, our model will misclassify these examples
too. In the end, our thought experiment reveals that hiding the gradient didn’t
get us anywhere.</p>

<p>Hence, we call this flawed defense strategy <strong>gradient masking</strong>, a term
introduced in [PMG16]. The defense strategies that perform gradient masking
typically result in a model that is very smooth in specific directions and
neighborhoods of training points, which makes it harder for the adversary to
find gradients indicating good candidate directions to perturb the input in a
damaging way for the model. However, the adversary can train a <em>substitute</em>
model: a copy that imitates the defended model by observing the labels that the
defended model assigns to inputs chosen carefully by the adversary. A procedure
for performing such a model extraction attack was introduced in [PMG16]. The
adversary can then use the substitute model’s gradients to find adversarial
examples that are misclassified by the defended model as well. In the figure
below, reproduced from the discussion of gradient masking found in [PMS16], we
illustrate this attack strategy with a one-dimensional ML problem. The gradient
masking phenomenon would be exacerbated for higher dimensionality problems, but
harder to depict.</p>

<div style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:30px;"><img src="Is%20attacking%20machine%20learning%20easier%20than%20defending%20it%3F_files/gradient-masking.png" width="75%"></div>

<p>Surprisingly, we find that both adversarial training and defensive distillation
accidentally perform a kind of gradient masking. If we transfer adversarial
examples from one model to another model trained with one of these defenses,
the attack often succeeds, even when a direct attack on the second model would
fail [PMG16]. This suggests that both training techniques do more to flatten
out the model and remove the gradient than to make sure it classifies more
points correctly.</p>

<h3 id="playing-a-game-of-whack-a-mole">Playing a game of “whack-a-mole”</h3>

<p>In the game of “hide the gradient,” we saw that gradient masking was not a very
good defense. It defends against an attacker who uses the gradient, but if the
attacker knows we are using that defense, they can just switch to a
transferability attack. In security terminology, this means that gradient
masking is not an <strong>adaptive</strong> defense.</p>

<p>Most defenses against adversarial examples that have been proposed so far just
do not work very well at all, but the ones that do work are not adaptive. This
means it is like they are playing a game of whack-a-mole: they close some
vulnerabilities, but leave others open.</p>

<p>Adversarial training requires choosing an algorithm to generate adversarial
examples. Usually, the model is trained to resist cheap adversarial examples
that are generated in a single step, like with the fast gradient sign method.
After training to resist these cheap adversarial examples, the model is usually
successfully able to resist new instances of the same kind of cheap adversarial
example. If we then use expensive, iterative adversarial examples, like those
in [SZS13], the model is usually fooled.</p>

<p>Guaranteeing adaptiveness is challenging. Inspiration may be taken from the
framework of <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf">differential
privacy</a>, which
offers a formal guarantee that a randomized algorithm does not expose
individual users’ privacy. This guarantee holds without making assumptions
about the adversary’s knowledge or capabilities, and as such holds in the face
of future hypothetical attacks engineered by adversaries.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-hard-to-defend-against-adversarial-examples">Why is it hard to defend against adversarial examples?</h3>

<p>Adversarial examples are hard to defend against because it is hard to construct
a theoretical model of the adversarial example crafting process. Adversarial
examples are solutions to an optimization problem that is non-linear and
non-convex for many ML models, including neural networks. Because we don’t have
good theoretical tools for describing the solutions to these complicated
optimization problems, it is very hard to make any kind of theoretical argument
that a defense will rule out a set of adversarial examples.</p>

<p>From another point of view, adversarial examples are hard to defend against
because they require machine learning models to produce good outputs <em>for every
possible input</em>. Most of the time, machine learning models work very well but
only work on a very small amount of all the many possible inputs they might
encounter.</p>

<p>Because of the massive amount of possible inputs, it is very hard to design a
defense that is truly adaptive.</p>

<h3 id="other-attack-and-defense-scenarios">Other attack and defense scenarios</h3>

<p>Several other kinds of attacks against machine learning are difficult to defend
against. In this post, we have focused on test-time inputs intended to confuse
a machine learning model, but many other kinds of attacks are possible, such as
attacks based on surreptitiously modifying the training data to cause the model
to learn to behave the way the attacker wishes it to behave.</p>

<p>One bright spot in adversarial machine learning is differential privacy, where
we actually have theoretical arguments that certain training algorithms can
prevent attackers from recovering sensitive information about the training set
from a trained model.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare machine learning to other scenarios where attacks
and defenses are both possible.</p>

<p>In cryptography, the defender seems to have the advantage. Given a set of
reasonable assumptions, such as that the cryptographic algorithm is implemented
correctly, the defender can reliably send a message that the attacker cannot
decrypt.</p>

<p>In physical conflict, attackers seem to have the advantage. It is much easier
to build a nuclear bomb than to build a city that is able to withstand a
nuclear explosion. The second law of thermodynamics seems to imply that, if
defending requires maintaining entropy below some threshold, then the defender
must eventually lose as entropy increases over time, even if there is no
explicit adversary intentionally causing this increase in entropy.</p>

<p>The no free lunch theorem for supervised learning [W96] says that, averaged over
all possible datasets, no machine learning algorithm does better on new
points at test time than any other algorithm.
At first glance, this seems to suggest that all algorithms are equally vulnerable
to adversarial examples.
However, the no free lunch theorem applies only when we make no assumption about
the structure of the problem.
When we study adversarial examples, we assume that small perturbations of the input
should not change the output class, so the no free lunch theorem in its typical
form does not apply.</p>

<p>Formally exposing the tension between robustness to adversaries and
model performance on clean data remains an active research question.
In [PMS16], a first no free lunch theorem for adversarial examples in machine learning
shows that such a tension exists when learning from limited data. The
result shows that defenders can thwart adversarial examples by moving
to richer hypothesis classes. However, the tension stems from challenges faced
when the
appropriate data and learning algorithms are not available to learn models
with high fidelity.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The study of adversarial examples is exciting because many of the most
important problems remain open, both in terms of theory and in terms of
applications. On the theoretical side, no one yet knows whether defending
against adversarial examples is a theoretically hopeless endeavor (like trying
to find a universal machine learning algorithm) or if an optimal strategy would
give the defender the upper ground (like in cryptography and differential
privacy). On the applied side, no one has yet designed a truly powerful defense
algorithm that can resist a wide variety of adversarial example attack
algorithms. We hope our readers will be inspired to solve some of these
problems.</p>
